      <h1>This is Patricio</h1>

      <p>
        The thing I like the most in this life is football — just like Mauro. But the difference is that instead of Real Madrid, my favorite team is
        <strong>FC Barcelona</strong>. I’ve been a fan for as long as I can remember, and I always get excited when they play.

          I also enjoy playing football with my friends after school.

        <li>
          I have two cats — their names are <strong>Goma</strong> and <strong>Crallola</strong>. They’re both girls and they’re the same age.
        </li>

        <li>
          One of my dreams is to visit Camp Nou in Barcelona and watch a live game. I want to feel the energy of the stadium, wear the jersey, and shout along with all the fans.
