      <h1>This is Mauro</h1>

      <p>
        I like to watch and play football. It’s one of my favorite things to do in my free time, and I always feel excited when there’s a match.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          My two favorite football teams are:
          <ul>
            <li>Club América</li>
            <li>Real Madrid</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          My favorite player is Cristiano Ronaldo. I admire his speed, skills, and how he always gives his best. I hope one day I can see him play in real life.
        </li>

        <li>
          My favorite food is ramen. I like the flavor and the texture — it’s warm, comforting, and always delicious.
        </li>

        <li>
          I had a dog named Freddy. He passed away, but he will always have a special place in my heart. He was kind, playful, and a big part of my life.
        </li>

        <li>
          I also enjoy playing video games with my friends, especially football games like FIFA. I think it’s fun to create dream teams and compete.
        </li>

        <li>
          In the future, I would like to travel to Spain to watch a Real Madrid game at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium. That would be a dream come true.
