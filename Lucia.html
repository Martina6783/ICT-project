      <ul>
        <li>My birthday is on February 9th. I really like to swim, act, and spend time with my friends.</li>
        <li>I have an older sister who is 2 years older than me.</li>
        <li>I have 3 dogs â€” they are my favorite things in the world.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I want to become an actress like Emma Stone. I hope to study at Juilliard in New York and later move to Los Angeles to continue my professional career.
