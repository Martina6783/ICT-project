      <p>
        I like to dance, play the bass and violin, and listen to music — it makes me feel very comfortable and happy.

          This year I went to Asia with my mom. The places we visited were:
          <ul>
            <li>Japan</li>
            <li>Hiroshima</li>
            <li>Hakone</li>
            <li>Korea</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>My birthday is January 26, and I was born in 2011.</li>
        <li>I have a brother who is 6 years older than me. We didn't used to get along, but now we don’t fight — we just don’t talk much.</li>
        <li>I have a very good relationship with my dad.</li>
        <li>I have 2 dogs — one is very old, but that doesn’t make me love him any less.</li>

          My favorite artists are:

            <li>Billie Eilish</li>
          </ul>
